Advbox Family is a series of AI model security tools set of Baidu Open Source,including the generation, detection and protection of adversarial examples, as well as attack and defense cases for different AI applications.

## AdvBox
Advbox is a toolbox to generate adversarial examples that fool neural networks in PaddlePaddle、PyTorch、Caffe2、MxNet、Keras、TensorFlow and Advbox can benchmark the robustness of machine learning models.Advbox give a command line tool to generate adversarial examples with Zero-Coding.

## AdvDetect
AdvDetect is a toolbox to detect adversarial examples from massive data.

## Stealth T-shirt
On defcon, we demonstrated T-shirts that can disappear under smart cameras. Under this sub-project, we open-source the programs and deployment methods of smart cameras for demonstration.
